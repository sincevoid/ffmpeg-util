This project provides a **batch script (.bat)** to automate various video editing tasks using **FFmpeg**. The script is useful for video editors who need to process large volumes of videos with common operations such as conversion, trimming, resolution changes, and more.

## üöÄ **How to Use**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - **FFmpeg** must be installed and accessible via the command line. If you don't have FFmpeg, you can download it [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
   - Add **FFmpeg** to your system's **PATH** environment variable to run it from any directory.

2. **Download the Script:**
   - Download the **`process_videos.bat`** file.
   - Place the file in a directory with the videos you want to process.

3. **Instructions:**
   - Open the **Command Prompt** on Windows.
   - Navigate to the directory where the script is saved and run it with the command:
     ```
     process_videos.bat
     ```

4. **Choose an Action:**
   - The script will display a menu with various options to process your videos. You can choose the action by typing the corresponding number.

## üé• **Available Menu Options**

   Resizes the video to **Full HD** resolution (1920x1080) with high quality.

4. **Render to 1080x1920 (vertical) [high quality]**
   Resizes the video to **Full HD** resolution (1080x1920) with high quality for vertical videos.

5. **Merge All Videos (Concatenate)**
   Merges all MP4 videos found in the directory into a single file.

6. **Render to 3840x2160 (4K horizontal) [maximum quality]**
   Resizes the video to **4K** (3840x2160) with maximum quality.

7. **Render to 2160x3840 (4K vertical) [maximum quality]**
   Resizes the video to **4K** (2160x3840) with maximum quality for vertical videos.

8. **Mute All Videos (remove audio)**
   Removes the audio from all videos in the directory, keeping only the video.

9. **Trim Video (from X to Y)**

13. **Change FPS (Frames per Second)**
   Changes the FPS of the video (ideal for slow-motion cameras or adapting to different frame rates).

14. **Create Timelapse from PNG Images**
   Creates a video from sequential PNG images (e.g., frame_0001.png, frame_0002.png, etc.), useful for timelapse.

15. **Adjust Color (Brightness/Contrast/Saturation)**
   Adjusts the color of the video by modifying brightness, contrast, and saturation.

16. **Add Logo to Lower Right Corner**
